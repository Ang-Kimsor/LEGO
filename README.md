## About The Project 🧱

This project is a clone of the LEGO toy website, built to capture the fun and colorful vibe of the original.  
You can browse through different toy sets, check out details, and see cool images just like on the real site.  
It’s designed to feel playful and easy to use, with bright colors and simple navigation.  
The site works great on phones, tablets, and computers, so you can explore LEGO wherever you are.  
It’s a fun project for anyone who loves LEGO or wants to practice building interactive, kid-friendly websites.  
While it doesn’t have a full shopping cart or checkout, it shows how to create a clean and engaging product showcase.  
Perfect for showcasing your web skills or making a neat portfolio piece with a playful theme.  
If you grew up loving LEGO or just like building websites that look great and work smoothly, this is a good one to check out!  
It’s all about recreating that classic LEGO feel with modern tools.  
Have fun exploring the bricks and sets!
